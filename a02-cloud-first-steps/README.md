# A2 – Cloud First Steps

> Launch EC2 instances using Amazon EC2 and configure basic access using public IP and HTTP.

---

## Overview

This lab involves launching two EC2 instances from the AWS Console, choosing the correct instance type after comparison, and verifying HTTP access through the public IP.

---

## Key Highlights

- Compared **t2.micro** and **t3.micro** instance types before launching  
- Selected **t3.micro** for better baseline performance  
- Launched two EC2 instances in default VPC with auto-assigned public IP  
- Did not use SSH — tested connectivity using public IP and HTTP (browser access)  
- No tagging or key pair used
