> Setting up VPC peering between departments to enable secure inter-VPC communication.

## Overview

This lab demonstrates how to connect two separate Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) using VPC peering. Each VPC represents a department in the city’s marketing team, and the goal is to allow secure communication between them while maintaining separate network environments.

## Key Highlights

- Created and configured two individual VPCs
- Launched EC2 instances in each VPC with subnet-level control
- Created a VPC peering connection between both VPCs
- Modified route tables to enable traffic flow across VPCs
- Verified communication by using ping between instances
